## Hi, I'm Anjana!

I love building [language technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_technology) and programming in languages like Python and JavaScript. At the moment I'm doing my coding at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com).

For more about me, please check out my [bio]({{ site.baseurl }}about/) and [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}resume/).

For extra fun, take a look at some of the [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}projects/) I've worked on.

Feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) or on [Github]({{ site.author.github }}).

Thanks for dropping by!

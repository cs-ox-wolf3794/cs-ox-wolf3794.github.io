title: About me
---

Unlike other technologists, my passion is not driven by the technology in the context itself, but rather the problem it is trying to solve. I use several digital tools in order to master them enough to convert a partially observable problem to a fully observable problem in a real-world scenario. And I trust human evolution enough to take it from there when it comes to judgements. The problems I am passionate about being on the lines of Education at a granular level, environmental protection, climate change and (vaguely enough) day-to-day operational efficiencies in a typical workplace that are trying to do something constructive.

I have a Master degree in Computer Science from [Oxford University](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk) in the U.K., where I studied Computational Linguistics, Information Retrieval and Intelligent Systems. Since then, I have been employed with an Investment Bank working an electronic trading platform focused on Fixed Income Securities. As part of my experience there, I picked up a fair bit of knowledge on various Financial Instruments, their operational and trade life cycles and their association with several markets. However, my primary focus was on technologies like Python (including libraries like numpy and scipy) and producing several end-to-end solutions for Front-Office trading teams and Middle-Office operations teams globally. As part of my experience, I got to visit and work with several Fixed Income traders in London and New York.

In May 2016, I quit Investment Banking and as a part of my sabbatical, I had an epiphany regarding my passions and interests. And ever since, I have worked on several projects associated with various bodies (sovereign and private) to bring grassroots level changes through the means of technology. I was then headhunted as the Head of Technology of a prestigious Education Management and Consulting firm and additionally was brought in as the Head Consultant of a publicly funded digital initiative for public school and colleges in Scotland, UK.

When I am not working, I love travelling, binge-watching TV shows, spend time with Family and Friends and sometimes all of them at once. I am also a self-declared experimental filmmaker and a culinary enthusiast.

title: "World, say hello to Kimi!"
---

In week 7 of my batch here at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com), I started (and finished) a new project: creating and interpreting a programming language.
My goal for this language was less to build a language you can actually code in, and more to simply learn about programming languages and interpreters, as this is something I find really interesting but have almost no experience with.

## What is Kimi?

[Kimi](https://github.com/vakila/kimi) is a little toy language with only the most basic features a small, elegant language needs, and nothing more.
The name "Kimi" stands for Keep It MInimal, which is exactly what I tried to do with this project.

## Why did I build Kimi?
A few weeks into my batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), resident [Prabhakar Ragde](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/) gave a talk called "Small, Elegant, Practical: The benefits of a minimal approach", in which he laid out a minimal set of features (see below) for a small, elegant programming language. It was interesting to know that a programming language doesn't in principle need to have a huge set of features, like most of the major languages do.

I didn't know much about programming languages before coming to RC, and although I had a vague sense of what interpreters/compilers do, I didn't really know what was going on under the hood. So, with some inspiration from Prabhakar's talk, and some encouragement from RC facilitator [John Workman](http://workmajj.com/), I decided to write a little interpreter for such a minimal language myself.

## How did I build Kimi?
In crafting the language, I tried to stick as closely as possible to minimal set of features laid out by Prabhakar:

* Lambda expressions
* Some useful built-in functions (e.g. arithmetic)
* Function application
* Variable definition
* Conditional evaluation
* Lists

To write the interpreter, I loosely followed two tutorials:

* the [Programming language project](http://eloquentjavascript.net/11_language.html) outlined by this week's RC resident, [Marijn Haverbeke](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/), in his excellent and fun book [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net). Marijn himself also provided invaluable assistance by pair-programming with me on some components of the interpreter.
* [Peter Norvig]()'s tutorial [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).

## What does Kimi code look like?
Here's a sample Kimi program, `factorial.kimi`, which defines a recursive function to compute the factorial of a given number, and then applies that function to the number `3`:

{% highlight hylang %}
(do
    (define fact
        (lambda n
            (if (= n 0) 1
                (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
    (fact 3)
)
{% endhighlight %}

Running this program in the Kimi interpreter produces the result `6`.

Several other examples are available in the `samples/` directory of the [Kimi repo](https://github.com/vakila/kimi).

## What did I learn from this project?
Before starting work on Kimi, I had a very shallow understanding of what an interpreter actually does. Through this project, I learned how an interpreter:

* Tokenizes the raw source code into distinct pieces
* Parses those tokens into an abstract syntax tree representing the structure of the program
* Evaluates the expressions in that tree recursively
* Creates and keeps track of a hierarchy of environments, i.e. contexts in which expressions are evaluated
* Makes use of special syntactic forms (e.g. `if` statements, `lambda` expressions, and imperative `do` blocks) to decide how to evaluate certain expressions

This project was also a great opportunity to practice Test-Driven Development; before implementing a given feature (e.g. a built-in function like `+`), I wrote tests using Python's `unittest` to capture the desired behavior, watched them fail, and then wrote the code that made them pass. I loved the structure and gratification I got from TDD on this project - seeing those tests pass is so rewarding! - so I'll definitely keep using this development strategy in the future.


## What's next for Kimi?
For the time being, I'm satisfied with Kimi's feature set and will be switching focus to other projects. But in the unlikely case of a future time and energy surplus, I'll also try to implement some nice-to-have features, such as:

* Built-in string functions (e.g. `concat` or `find`)
* Simple I/O (e.g. `print`)
* Macros
* Maps
* Arbitrary structures using S-expressions (a la XML or JavaScript objects)

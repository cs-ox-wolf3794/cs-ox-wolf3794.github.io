title: Notes from JSUnconf 2016
subtitle: "Or, how I gave my first tech talk (on 3 hours' notice)"
---

This conference was awesome: not too big, not too cramped of a schedule (long breaks between talk sessions), free drinks, snacks & meals (with vegan options!), unisex bathrooms (toiletries & tampons provided!), a code of conduct, and - most importantly, to me - a great diversity program that gave me and 16 others support to attend! The unconference format was really interesting, and worked better than I expected. It also enabled something I wasn't planning on: I gave my first talk at a tech conference!

## What's an unconference?

There's no pre-planned schedule; instead, at the beginning of each day, anyone who's interested in giving a talk makes a short pitch of their topic, and for the next hour or so the rest of the attendees vote on which talks they want to attend. The highest-voted talks are selected, and begin shortly after that. It sounds like it would be chaos, but it works!

## I gave my first tech talk! On 3 hours' notice!

On day 2 of the conference, in a completely unexpected turn of events, I proposed, planned, and delivered a 30-minute talk within a period of about 3 hours. Am I crazy? Perhaps. But the good kind of crazy!

See, there had been some interest in functional programming in JS (as part of the unconference format, people can submit topics they'd like to *hear* a talk on as well), and some talks on specific topics related to functional languages/libraries, but no one had proposed a high-level general introduction about it. So, at literally the last minute of the talk-proposal session, I spontaneously got up and pitched "Learning Functional Programming with JS" (that's how I learned FP, after all!).

Turns out people were indeed interested: my proposal actually got more votes than any other that day. Which meant that I would present in the main room, the only one out of the three tracks that was being recorded. So all I had to do was, you know, plan a talk and make slides from scratch and then speak for 30 minutes in front of a camera, all in the space of about 3 hours.

Yay! No, wait... panic!

Luckily my years of teaching experience and a few presentations at academic conferences came to the rescue. I had to skip a couple of the sessions before mine (luckily some talks were recorded), and get a little instant feedback from a few folks at the conference that I had gotten to know, but ultimately I was able to throw together a talk outline and some [slides](https://slidr.io/vakila/learning-functional-programming-with-javascript).

When it came to actually delivering the talk, it was actually less scary than I thought. I even had enough time to do an ad-hoc digression (on the chalkboard!!!) into persistent data structures, which are the topic of my first *scheduled* tech talk at [!!Con 2016](http://bangbangcon.com/speakers.html#anjana-vakil).

So, how did it go? I'll let Twitter tell you:

Aw geez y'all, I'm blushing! :D

The whole thing was a great experience, and definitely gave me a huge confidence boost for speaking at more conferences in the future (look out, [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/speakers.html#anjana-vakil) and [EuroPython](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/p/-958)!). I would recommend it to anyone! Come to think of it, [why aren't you giving talks yet?](https://speakerdeck.com/sheley/why-arent-you-giving-talks-yet-jsunconf2016)

## Some things I learned at JSUnconf

- The unconference format is pretty sweet!
- Giving a tech talk is not as scary as all that!
- HTTP/2 is a thing
- Service Workers are a thing
- There is a library for building neural nets in JS: [Synaptic](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/#/)
- I want to learn Elm
- Flora Power Mate is so much better than Club Mate (i.e. it actually tastes like mate)!

## Talk notes

These are the unedited notes I jotted down during the talks. Mistakes, omissions, and misunderstandings are totally possible! Don't take my word for anything; when in doubt check out the [slides](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UztwJ7g-R0L6WznNF6JYWwamMsChZeAL_VV2qyrSe8o/edit#gid=0)!

### HTTP/2

Speaker: Ole Michaelis (@CodeStars, nesQuick on Github), from Jimdo

- HTTP/1.1 has been in use since 1997
- But it has some problems:
  - Lots of requests required to load a single page; "request bonanza"
  - Have to load the page itself, assets, ad stuff, tracking stuff....
  - Requests have to be done one-at-a-time, creating a "'waterfall' of blocked requests"
  - This causes latency (e.g. ~10 second load time for a web page like The Verge)
  - Especially problematic for mobile
- You can get around it with weird hacks/workarounds, but these could violate best practices
- Google made a thing called SPDY ("speedy"), which was sort of a predecessor to...
- [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/faq/) is the real solution
  - Binary, not text
  - Single TCP connection, but multiple streams with requests running in parallel
  - Headers are compressed
- Each browser can determine how to figure out/build the tree of dependencies
  - Firefox has the most efficient implementation at the moment
  - It sets up the dependency tree of requests before actually making any requests (?)
- Sidenote: Huffman encoding
  - Take a string to compress
  - Count the frequencies of each character
  - Make a binary tree such that the leaf nodes are the characters arranged left-to-right from most frequent to least, and the leaves are connected through binary nodes from right to left, where each branch is labeled 0 on the left and 1 on the right
  - Use the path from the root of the tree to the character's leaf node as the compression table
  - So the most frequent character will be 00, the least frequent will be e.g. 1111
  - This means more frequent characters have shorter compressions, so the overall compression will be as small as possible
- HTTP/2 is already in use (22% of sites(???)) - you should start using it now!
  - Customers using HTTP/1.1 will experience an increase in load times, but those using updated browsers will see a decrease



### Natural user interfaces using JS

Speaker: @princi_ya, from Zalando

- Gesture-based interfaces, e.g. Intel RealSense 3D, Leap Motion
- Some terminology:
  - Augmented Reality, also called Mediated Reality(?): real environment augmented with virtual components
  - Virtual Reality: totally simulated environment
  - Perceptual Computing: automatically perceiving what's happening in the environment
- Using JS/the browser to communicate with RealSense/Leap Motion SDK via WebSocket server and getUserMedia to access the user's webcam
- JS-Object Detect - open-source library for object detection from webcam
- Unfortunately not very accurate - demo didn't work


### Elm: Web development with delight

Speaker: Bastian Krol (@bastiankrol), from codecentric

[Slides](https://basti1302.github.io/talks/2016_jsunconf_hh_elm/index.html#/)

- Why Elm?
  - Clean syntax - inspired by Haskell(?) and OCaml
  - No runtime exceptions (!!!) - if code compiles, it will run
  - Interoperates smoothly with vanilla JS, you can use JS libraries
  - Reduces bug hunting
  - Everything is stateless & immutable
    - application is composed out of stateless functions
    - removes a whole category of bugs in JS
- Hello world:
```
import Html
main = Html.text "Hello Hamburg!"
```
- Convention: every Elm app has a "main" module, and that module has a "main" function

- Optional type annotations (best practice to add type annotations to all your top-level functions):
    ```
    import Html exposing (Html)

    greet : Int -> String -> Html
    greet number string =
      Html.text str

    main : Html
    main =
      greet "Hello Hamburg"
    ```

- Elm supports partial function application
  - when it takes in the `Int` in the `greet` function above, it essentially returns an anonymous function that takes a `String` and returns an `Html`
  - so there's no real difference between
  `greet : Int -> String -> Html` and `greet : Int -> (String -> Html)`
- Signals
  - use `Signal.map` to do something with the input from the signal (e.g. map `Mouse.x` to Html)
  - can filter signals do drop certain events if you're not interested
  - you can also
  - Further reading:
    - [Elm guide to reactivity](http://elm-lang.org/guide/reactivity)
    - Elm architecture tutorial
- Architecture
  - Features:
    - Unidirectional data flow
    - Single source of truth
    - Everything immutable & stateless
    - ...these are similar to Redux and other popular libraries (who may have copied these features from Elm)
  - Uniform structure for apps
  - Main concepts:
    - Model: custom type that you declare (could be a simple int or a huge data structure)
    - Update: function that takes an action and the current model, and produces a new model (`Action -> Model -> Model`)
    - View: function that turns a model into an Html structure (essentially how you render the model)
- Compiler
  - Catches edge cases etc., e.g. empty lists
  - So if your code compiles it will run - no runtime errors!


### Shipping an app to production using WebMIDI and WebAudio: Lessons learned

Speaker: Jan Krutisch

- Web Audio API
  - allows you to generate, play back, modify, filter, etc. digital sounds/music of any sort in a flexible way
  - can build synthesizers with it, use audio in your games, etc. etc.
- Web MIDI API
  - MIDI: Musical Instrument Digital Interface
- Weird bit operations in JS


### Some experiences building an Android app with React Native & Redux

Speaker: Alex Bepple (@alexbepple), from [it-agile](http://it-agile.de)

- Introducing a new term: Owdaf - One-way reactive data flow (aka unidirectional data flow)
- What's cool about Owdaf?
  - All UI is a functional representation of the state of the (web/mobile/whatever) app
  - The user always sees the same thing if the state is the same
  - Changing what the user sees requires dispatching an action - but the presentational components don't need to know anything about that
  - You change something in one place, and everything in UI gets updated automatically
- React Native
  - Bridge between JS and the UI
  - You have native components for the given mobile platform, but they're controlled from a JS thread
  - Great [ecosystem of components](http://js.coach/react-native)
  - Some gotchyas: `require` is different than in node, problems centering a grid, ...
- Redux:
  - brings Owdaf to React Native (?)
  - can persist state using redux-storage library
  - can use libraries like redux-act to create actions and reducers
  - encapsulation is a problem (?)
  - there's supposed to be time-traveling, but it didn't work last he checked
- React Native & Redux together:
  - Biggest gotchya: how to represent navigation in your global state?
  - for regular React there is react-router-redux
  - no such thing for React Native (because the concept of a URL doesn't really exist in a native app)

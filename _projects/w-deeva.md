Deeva is a platform for experimental research on the personality traits
associated with 3D virtual human avatars. It collects crowdsourced judgments
about avatars and uses these to drive a genetic algorithm to progressively
"evolve" avatars representative of various personality traits.

The prototype for the platform was created as a group project in the
C.S. course "Software Engineering" at Saarland University.
In addition to helping design and code the web application in Python/Django,
my individual contributions included implementing the genetic algorithm,
writing and revising project requirements, and using RedMine to manage the
project and lead our 3-person team in meeting goals.

Kimi ("Keep It MInimal") is a lisp-like toy programming language 
I created to learn more about programming languages and interpreters. 
Its interpreter was built in Python 3 using Test-Driven Development.
Kimi is a small, elegant language with a minimal set of features 
(see the [Readme](https://github.com/vakila/kimi) for more details).

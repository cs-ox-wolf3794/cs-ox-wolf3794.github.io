This prototype Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training
(CAPT) tool provides a variety of options for diagnosis of and
feedback on a type of pronunciation error that is commonly problematic
for French learners of German. A web app built with Groovy and the
Grails framework, its backend builds upon two Java applications:
JSnoori (speech processing and analysis) and Weka (machine learning).

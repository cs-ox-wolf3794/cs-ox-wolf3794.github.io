lex4all is a Windows desktop app written in C#.
Implementing an algorithm for automatic pronunciation discovery,
it uses Microsoft's speech recognition engine for a high-resource language
(e.g. English) to generate pronunciations for words in a low-resource language
(e.g. Yoruba) from a handful of audio samples. Thanks to a simple GUI,
the app allows even non-expert users to develop pronunciation lexicons
to enable the creation of speech interfaces even in languages for which
no large-vocabulary recognition engines are available. For more information,
see the project website and the related publications available there.

Net-set is a colorful, fast-paced, competitive card game you play in the browser.
It's inspired by the real-life card game [Set®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)).

The app was written in JavaScript using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/).
Its backend uses functional programming principles and persistent data structures via the  [Mori](http://swannodette.github.io/mori/) library, and was developed using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) for TDD.
The frontend makes use of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Underscore.js templates](http://underscorejs.org/#template); all designs are pure CSS.
